# Lab Navigator

Currently designing with APM in mind. Will later strip out APM content.

## Using profiles

To make student and 'answers' version separately, have implemented quarto profiles.

Normal version:
```
quarto render index.qmd
```

Answers included version:
```
quarto render index.qmd --profile answers
```

This is implemented via the following way to defining answers:
```
:::{.content-visible when-profile="answers"}
:::{.answer}
```

*Note*: First attempt, via including `.answer` in the outer block didn't work as `.content-visible` is implemented by hiding the entire outer div when it's shown, and thus the class answer div was lost.
